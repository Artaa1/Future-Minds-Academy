        <p>
            Prizren is the jewel in the crown of Kosovo and a ‘must-see’ for any visitor. <br>
            <strong>Prizeren</strong> has the highest number of preserved Ottoman buildings with their upper storeys
            jutting out into the narrow cobbled streets.<br>
            Prizren has not only retained the architecture from the Ottoman era but also many other flavours of Turkey,
            with the language being widely used, and delicious Turkish food.<br>
            Many schools in Prizren still teach in Turkish and it is the only municipality where Turkish is an official
            language alongside Albanian and Serbian so you will see it on street signs and it also appears on tax
            bills.<br>
            Several radio stations broadcast in Turkish and there is a weekly Turkish-language newspaper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prizren is the most ethnically mixed municipality with large numbers of Bosnians and Turks and also Roma,
            Gorani and Terbesh.<br>

            <i> Approximately 221,000 people live in the municipality,</i> with between 40,000 and 60,000 in the city
            itself.<br>
            It’s a young population with the schools operating up to two shifts a day and up to 50 in the class.<br>

            The town pretty well escaped damage in the 1998–99 war, but when the Albanians returned in summer 1999 a
            considerable number of Serbian homes were looted and burnt.<br>

            The town of Prizren is close to the Albanian border, with mountains on two sides. <br> It has good access to
            water, <strong>with the Bistrica/Lumbardhi River </strong> flowing fast through the town and a pleasant
            sheltered climate.

            <h3>What to visit in Prizren</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong> Gazi Mehmet Pasha Hammam </strong> These Turkish baths were built in 1573 by Gazi Mehmet Pasha
                at the same time as the mosque nearby (which also included a madrasa).<br>
                The baths consisted of separate male and female areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The League of Prizren complex</strong> Part of the League complex, with the entrance behind (as
                opposed to from the riverside) behind the wooden fencing is Gazi Mehmet Pasha</strong> or<strong>
                    Bajrakli Mosque.</strong> <br>
                This dates from 1566 and is possibly the most beautiful mosque in Prizren (on a par with Gjakova’s Hadum
                Mosque) with ornate woodwork and detailed blue-and-white paintings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Sinan Pasha Mosque</strong> just across the bridge, is regarded as Prizren’s main mosque. <br>
                It takes its name from its founder Sinan Pasha, who built this impressive mosque in 1615.<br>
                The ruler had the prefix ‘Sofi’ added to his name in recognition of his wisdom. ETC

        <h4> Prizren Fortress</h4>
        <p>
            It's well worth making the steep 15-minute hike up from Prizren's old town, for the superb views over the
            city and on into the distance.<br>
            The fortress itself is a little tumble-down but restoration work is currently underway. In the evening heaps
            of locals come up here and a slight carnival atmosphere prevails.<br>
            In the white-heat of day, it can be quite lifeless.
            Archeological remains have been found here dating back as far as 1100 BC, but the first fortress was built
            here by the Byzantines.<br>
            It was then expanded by successive Serbian kings in the 12th to 14th centuries before becoming a seat of
            power for the Ottoman rulers of Kosovo until their expulsion in 1912.<br>
            Information panels in English give further explanations of the site's past.<br>

            <i>In the summer occasional concerts and theatrical events are staged within the fortress grounds.</i>
