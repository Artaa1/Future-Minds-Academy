            The earliest archaeological find is the so-called <i> Runner of Prizren </i> which is a bronze figure of a
            running girl.<br>
            A dealer sold it to the British Museum in 1876.According to the museum, the object was possibly made in
            Sparta
            between 520BC and 500BC.<br>
            It may have arrived in Prizren as a gift or loot and used as a grave-god.

            Prizren has been traditionally identified with <strong>Theranda</strong>, a town of the Roman era.<br>
            However, recent research suggests that Therand may have been located at present-day Suva Reka.

            Archaeological research has shown that the site of the Prizren Fortress has had several eras of habitation
            since
            prehistoric times.<br>
            In its lower part, material from the upper part of the fort has been deposited over the centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            It dates from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 BCE) to the late Iron Age (c. 1st century CE) and is comparable
            to
            the material found in the nearby prehistoric site in the village of Vlashnjë (~10 km west of Prizren).<br>
            In 2005, prehistoric rock paintings in a ritual site related to the cycle of life were found near Vlashnjë.
            <br>
            They represent the first find of prehistoric rock art in the region.

        <p>
            In late antiquity, the fortification saw a phase of reconstruction. <br>
            It is part of a series of forts that were built or reconstructed in the same period by Justinian along the
            White
            Drin in northern Albania and western Kosovo in the routes that linked the coastal areas with the Kosovo
            valley.<br>
            At this time, the Prizren fortress likely appears in historical record as Petrizen in the 6th century CE in
            the
            work of Procopius as one of the fortifications which Justinian commissioned to be reconstructed in Dardania.
