            Regarded as the historical capital of Kosovo, Prizren has been home to many different religions and cultures
            for
            centuries, shaping the cultural heritage of the city.<br>
            <i>Prizren is also considered a museum city with many mosques, churches, and old buildings of national
                importance.</i><br>
            The Fortress of Prizren, located above the Prizren River, has seen habitation and use throughout different
            periods
            since the Bronze Age.<br>
            Among the artifacts of the Middle Ages are the Sinan Pasha Mosque, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour Cathedral,
            Holy
            Saviour Church, Katip Sinan Qelebi Mosque, Holy Archangels Monastery, St. Nicholas Church, Muderiz Ali
            Effendi
            Mosque, and the UNESCO World Heritage Site Our Lady of Ljevi≈°.<br>

            <br>The annual Dokufest International Film Festival held in Prizren is considered among the largest publicly
            attended film festivals in the Balkans.<br>
            Several art and music festivals and conferences are held in the city, including the 40BunarFest and NGOM
            Fest,
            with the main objectives of promoting artists and connecting the different ethnic groups in the surrounding
            region.

            Prizren contains around 40 mosques in total. But out of all of them, the <strong>Sinan Pasha
                Mosque</strong>,
            which overlooks the city center, is the most prominent.
            <br> Built in 1615, it was named after a local vizier.

                    <h3>Sinan Pasha Mosque</h3>

                    <p>
                        The mosque's spacious interior stretches out to 14 x 14 meters, much of it painted in colorful
                        patterns and Arabic script.<br>
                        In terms of style, the art is reminiscent of the Painted Mosque in Tetovo, North Macedonia, just
                        on the
                        other side of the Shar Mountains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interestingly, the paintings were added in the 19th century, around the same time the Painted
                        Mosque was
                        rebuilt. <br>
                        Sadly, some of the original art has been lost due to water leakages.<br>
                        As a result, large sections of the walls remain blank white.<br>
                        In the 2010s, the mosque and the garden outside were restored with help from the Turkish
                        government.

                    <h3>Emin Pasha Mosque</h3>

                        <figcaption><strong>Emin Pasha Mosque</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Speaking of colorful mosques, the Emin Pasha Mosque on the other side of the river is also worth
                        a
                        visit.<br>
                        Established in 1832 in honor of Emin Pasha, governor of Prizren from 1789-1843, it was designed
                        by
                        architect Mehmet Emini.<br>
                        The mosque's arched facade is adorned with elegant blue and white floral motifs, giving it a
                        unique look
                        for the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But pictures of the interior reveal even more blue and white geometrical patterns and nature
                        scenery,
                        easily rivaling the artwork of the more famous Sinan Pasha Mosque.<br>
                        This mosque was also restored with help from the Turkish government as recently as 2016.
