     <h1>Culture in Prizeren City</h1>
    <p>Regarded as the historical capital of Kosovo, Prizren has been home to many different religions and cultures for centuries, shaping the cultural heritage of the city.<br>
        <i> Prizren is also considered as a museum city with many mosques, churches and old buildings of national importance.</i><br>
         The Fortress of Prizren located above the Prizren River has seen habitation and use throughout different periods since the Bronze Age.<br>
          Among the artifacts of the Middle Ages are the Sinan Pasha Mosque, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour Cathedral, Holy Saviour Church, Katip Sinan Qelebi Mosque, Holy Archangels Monastery, St. Nicholas Church, Muderiz Ali Effendi Mosque and the UNESCO World Heritage Site Our Lady of Ljeviš.<br>

          <br>The annual Dokufest International Film Festival held in Prizren is considered among the largest publicly attended film festival in the Balkans.<br>
           Several art and music festivals and conferences are held in the city, including the 40BunarFest and NGOM Fest, with the main objectives to promote artists and to connect the different ethnic groups in the surrounding region.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prizren contains around 40 mosques in total. But out of all of them, the <strong> Sinan Pasha Mosque,</strong> which overlooks the city center, is the most prominent.
        <br> Built in 1615, it was named after a local vizier.

    <p>
        The mosque’s spacious interior stretches out to 14 x 14 m. And much of it has been painted in colorful patterns and Arabic script.<br>
        In terms of style, the art is reminiscent of the Painted Mosque in Tetovo, North Macedonia, right on the other side of the Shar Mountains.

    <p>
        Interestingly, the paintings were added in the 19th century, around the same time the Painted Mosque was rebuilt. <br>
        Sadly, however, some of the original art has been lost due to water leakages. <br>

       As a result, large sections of the walls remain blank white. <br>
        In the 2010s, the mosque and garden outside were restored with help from the Turkish government.

    <li><strong> Emin Pasha Mosque</strong></li>
    <p>
        Speaking of colorful mosques, the Emin Pasha Mosque on the other side of the river is also worth a visit.<br>

         Established in 1832 in honor of Emin Pasha, governor of Prizren from 1789-1843, it was designed by architect Mehmet Emini.<br>
          The mosque’s arched facade is adorned with elegant blue and white floral motifs, giving it a unique look for the region.
    </p>
    <p>
        But pictures of the interior reveal even more blue and white geometrical patterns and nature scenery, easily rivaling the artwork of the more famous Sinan Pasha Mosque.<br>

        This mosque was also restored with help from the Turkish government as recently as 2016.
